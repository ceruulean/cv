                <h2>Process</h2>
                <ol>
                <li>Contact me about a commission with what you want, pricing, and references.</li>
                <li>We communicate to ensure clarification on the request or to make sure I can/will take it.</li>
                <li>If I approve the commission, I send an invoice as a record of our business.</li>
                <li>You pay the price in full for orders less than $100.
                <br>(For jobs over $100, you can opt to pay a 50% deposit instead)</li>
                <li>I begin working on the piece and keep frequent contact for major stages.
                        <br/>(sketch, lineart, color)
                </li>
                <li>When piece is finished, I will request payment of oustanding charges, if applicable.
                <br>Otherwise, if no outstanding balance, I send the final product.</li>
                </ol>
                
                        <h2>Timeline</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>I am a full-time university student.</li>
                <li>Usually small works should be completed within a week of approval (around $20 range).</li>
                <li>Of course it all depends on complexity, my waitlist, and life circumstances. I will let you know of any delays.</li>
                </ul>
                
                        <h2>Communication</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Please respond to emails preferably within a week.</li>
                <li>If I get no reponse at all within 30 days, the cancellation policy will take effect and I won't refund.</li>
                <li>I will do up to 30 minutes of phone calling for free, cumulative for one project.
                <br>After that, I charge $4 for each half-hour spent on the phone (31-60 minutes is +$4, 61-90 minutes is +$8, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                <li>If I cannot start your commission for any reason, I will refund the price paid (not including transaction fees).</li>
                <li>I will refund the price for cancellations made before initial sketches.</li>
