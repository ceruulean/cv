## Confluence Stale Reminder (WIP)

This is a utility for finding stale pages (pages which are over 6 months old) and emailing people to update them.

Future: Archiving capabilities.

## MkDocs Material Codelab Theme

This theme is perfect for task-based documentation: procedures, cookbooks, tutorials, and checklists.


ðŸ‘‰ [Demo](https://kibblab.gitlab.io/codelab-theme-mkdocs-material/guide/)

It is a derivation of [Hugo Codelab Themes](https://hugothemesfree.com/tag/codelabs/) (which are clones of an older version of [Google Codelabs](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools)), which can integrate and look consistent with [MkDocs Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
