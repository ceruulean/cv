## MkDocs Material Codelab Theme

A derivation of [Hugo Codelab Themes](https://hugothemesfree.com/tag/codelabs/) (clones of [Google Codelabs](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools)), which can integrate and look consistent with [MkDocs Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
