## [Prose Grinder Pandoc Templates](https://github.com/prosegrinder/pandoc-templates)

*Contributor of PowerShell port*

Premade scripts to format manuscripts for traditional (book) publishing, using Pandoc's templating features.

[Nonfiction](http://barbaramcnichol.com/2012/11/03/how-to-format-your-nonfiction-manuscript/) and fiction manuscripts look plain and [startingly similar to Markdown](https://www.shunn.net/format/). Hence, in order to make the process less tedious for authors, we recommend writing your chapters with Markdown. Many authors use Windows, so a Windows-compatible port of the Prose Grinder utilities are needed.
