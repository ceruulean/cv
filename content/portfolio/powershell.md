## [Prose Grinder Pandoc Templates](https://github.com/prosegrinder/pandoc-templates)

*Contributor of PowerShell port.*

Premade scripts to format text for traditional (book) publishing, using Pandoc's templating features.

[Formatted nonfiction](http://barbaramcnichol.com/2012/11/03/how-to-format-your-nonfiction-manuscript/) and fiction manuscripts looks suspiciously similar to Markdown. Hence, in order to make the process less tedious for authors, we recommend writing in Markdown in the first place. Many authors use Windows, so a Windows-compatible port of the Prose Grinder utilities are needed.
