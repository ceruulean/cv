## Services

📋 **Edit and proofread** to a Plain English style or a particular style guide. Preferred style guide is [ASD-STE100](https://asd-ste100.org/).

♿ **Audit the accessibility** of websites according to WCAG guidelines. Create a formal report and/or participate in design discussions to catch concerns before they're coded.

📐 **Draft** high quality graphics that conform to print standards and bleed margins.

🎙️ **Record voiceover and video captures** for informative media.

📝 **Write process communication documents** such as Letters of Inquiry, recommendation letters, resumes, website copy, and similar forms of ghostwriting.

📝 **Write technical product documents** which includes managing ownership, lifecycle and scope, determining publication targets, conducting research and synthesis, and scheduling time for review and revision.

⏰ **Optimize information delivery** which can mean: planning out the information architecture before writing a single word, identifying bottlenecks and automating what can be enforced in code, or easing in a cultural change (training may be needed to identify what needs to be written, and establish minimum requirements).
  - To expand on this, I mostly see myself in an "author-publisher" relationship. The author/contributor/Subject Matter Expert should only focus on raw content and a general idea of how they want to organize sections and chapters. Formatting, editing, distribution and revisions are the publisher's responsibility.
